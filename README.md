Mailbox Prototype
=================

Prototyping some gestures in Mailbox for iOS â€” one of my favorite iOS apps

**Time spent:** ~10 hours (still don't quite feel like i understand velocity, translation etc and wasn't able to get the side nav working properly)

**Tasks completed:** All required + kind of working side nav. Didn't start working on the modal for entering a new email, but that looked pretty easy.
